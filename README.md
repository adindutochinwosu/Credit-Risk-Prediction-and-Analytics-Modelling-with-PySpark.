# Credit-Risk-Prediction-and-Analytics-Modelling-with-PySpark.
Modelling of customer credit risk, using open-source data from an Indian financial institution, to predict customers likely to default on lending products.

From the  machine learning algorithm deployed, gradient boost performed better than the rest of the models, however the AUC value was only 67%. This value can be improved by tuning the parameters of the model using methods such as ParamGridBuilder and CrossValidator.
